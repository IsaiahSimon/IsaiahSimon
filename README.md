# Hi, I’m Isaiah 👋🏼🧑🏽‍💻

I'm a Software Engineer @ 100Devs and currently focused on Full Stack Web Development.

I enjoy working at the crossroads of modern technology, healthcare and humanity. I was born in Trinidad & Tobago, grew up in New York City, and currently located in the Central Delaware area. I love to travel, learn new skills, hobbies and all things tech.

I am able to communicate with people from all walks of life — having interacted with THOUSANDS of everyday people during time in Healthcare. I like to treat people with respect, and have walked alongside many on some of the brightest and darkest days in their lives.

I take great pride in persistence, diligence, and empathy. All of my experiences in healthcare influence many of my unique perspectives, and ultimately, the way I approach solving problems as a developer.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages. So far I have HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, Ruby, Git/GitHub,  responsive design principles, and WordPress under my belt. I also have a solid foundational knowledge of IT principles, including Centralized Management, Systems Admin, Routing concepts, Permissioning and Security.

I’m always up for an insightful coffee chat (well tea in my case), so feel free to reach out!

Perhaps you share one of my MANY random hobbies, skills or interests? 
Currently restoring a 112 year old home! | cars/trucks | bird-watching (new) | welding | custom PCs | fitness | video games | real estate | cryptocurrency | NFTs | photography | finance ...and I'm sure I've left some stuff out.
