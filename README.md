# My name is Isaiah Simon...
...and I LOVE to build cool things!

I'm a Software Engineer @ 100Devs, currently focused on Full Stack Web Development. Born in Trinidad & Tobago, grew up in New York City, and currently in Central Delaware.

I take great pride in my persistence, diligence, and punctuality. Prior experience in healthcare shapes my unique perspective, the way I approach problem-solving as a developer.

I'm a curious person by nature, with a lifelong passion for learning and self-improvement. My favorite toy as a kid was a set of lego blocks, and it cultivated this fire in me to take things apart, figure out what makes it tick, and imagine new ways to recombine the pieces â€” the old lego blocks may be gone, but the still fire burns strong thanks to code...

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages. So far I have HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, Ruby, Git/GitHub,  responsive design principles, and WordPress under my belt. I also have a solid foundational knowledge of IT principles, including Centralized Management, Systems Admin, Routing concepts, Permissioning and Security.

Iâ€™m always up for an insightful coffee chat (well tea in my case), so feel free to reach out!

Perhaps you share one of my MANY random hobbies, skills or interests? 
Currently restoring a 112 year old home! | cars/trucks | bird-watching (new) | welding | custom PCs | fitness | video games | real estate | cryptocurrency | NFTs | photography | finance ...and I'm sure I've left some stuff out.
