# Hi, I’m Isaiah 👋🏼🧑🏽‍💻


I'm taking "The Slow Path to Proficiency" mastering programming fundamentals at LaunchSchool. Currently learning Ruby, JavaScript, Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode, Python and C. I also enjoy working with Wordpress, building small websites using (Divi and WPOcean themes, Divi and Elementor page builders). I’m looking to collaborate on any project where I can be helpful and learn something new.
