# My name is Isaiah Simon...
...and I LOVE to build cool things!

I'm a Software Engineer @ 100Devs and currently focused on Full Stack Web Development.

I was born in Trinidad & Tobago, grew up in New York City, and currently located in the Central Delaware area. I love to travel, learn new skills, hobbies and all things tech.

I take great pride in persistence, diligence, and punctuality. My prior experience in healthcare shapes many of my unique perspectives, and ultimately, the way I approach solving problems as a developer.

I'm a curious person by nature, and have always had a passion for learning and self-improvement. My favorite toy as a kid was the humble lego block, and it cultivate this fire in me to take things apart, figure out what makes something tick, imagine new ways to recombine the pieces â€” my old lego blocks may be gone, but the fire burns strong thanks to code...

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages. So far I have HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, Ruby, Git/GitHub,  responsive design principles, and WordPress under my belt. I also have a solid foundational knowledge of IT principles, including Centralized Management, Systems Admin, Routing concepts, Permissioning and Security.

Iâ€™m always up for an insightful coffee chat (well tea in my case), so feel free to reach out!

Perhaps you share one of my MANY random hobbies, skills or interests? 
Currently restoring a 112 year old home! | cars/trucks | bird-watching (new) | welding | custom PCs | fitness | video games | real estate | cryptocurrency | NFTs | photography | finance ...and I'm sure I've left some stuff out.
